\textbf{Dedications}

I would like to dedicate this thesis to my wife, Tiffany Ritchie, our baby on the way, and my stepson Maddox Pino. My family has pushed me to finish my masterâ€™s and allow me to follow my dreams and complete my education. They have been there for me through everything, and I appreciate and love them so much.
