The content of the thesis is copyrighted, and can be used with proper annotation. Feel free to use the code as a way for you to figure out how to incorporate your content into a specific format. 

## Compiling Source
This was compiled in Overleaf. Other LaTeX editors may be used, but I only compiled it in Overlead. Your milagage may vary. 

To compile in overleaf:
1. Copy all source files into Overleaf with the current directory structure.
2. Overleaf will automatically compile the source
3. PDF preview will be generated after a brief compilation period
    *  **Note**: the free version of Overlead will compile the document without issue.
